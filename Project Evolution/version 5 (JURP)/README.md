Soot on glass were used as particles. They are easy to make (just using lighter to put soot on any surface like glass, metal, etc), they stick on the surface so doesn't create any mess, and they tend to be more stable.

and I removed the beam dump since the laser is focused and while pointed up, the ceiling can be acted as a beam dump.
But this violates the saftey regulation from OSHA (See OSHA Section III, chapter 6) so I created version 6.

Knowing that the previous versions (including this) violated regulation and stopped until safer version is developed.
But I had fun time playing with this, it was very simple design, materials, and operation.
Also I did some interesting experiments, diffraction pattern of laser with particle and drawing with long exposure photo.

Diffraction pattern demo

Pro: 
It looks cool, simple, cheap, easy to use.
Lots of different demos can be done.

Con:
It is not possible due to safty regulation.
