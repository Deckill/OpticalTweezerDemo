Previous version, particles were exposed to open enviroment, making it unstable. So I 3D printed a cube with each face open so I can put 22x22mm cover slit and contains powder in closed enviroment.

Then, by pointing the laser through one of transparent face, I could pick up the particle.

Pro: 
The particle is fully enclosed, allowing the particle to be stable.
It also created interaction by pointing laser to pile of powder, and by pointing laser in air, allowing floating particle to be trapped.

Con:
There are so many things used, 3D printed parts, cover slits, and copper plates.
