Changed the laser to 250mW 650nm laser. so it is much powerful, but doesn't hurt eyes.
Also, instead of placing particle, picking the particle with laser methods were used. (to prevent air turbulance as much as possible. and while placing, the movement of spoon creates turbulance.)
And transparent chamber is added.

Pro: 
By minimizing air turbulance, it is very stable and easy to visualise. 

Con:
By picking up particles, diamond powder should be held in a place but often ended up spilling the powder all over the place.
