This is suggested tutorial for optical tweezer.
This will cover Conservation of Momentum, Optical Tweezer Theory using Conservation of Momentum, and Optical Tweezer Demonstraion.

Tutorial-

I first started with explaining conservaion of momentum using PhET collision simulation.

With one ball standing still, while other ball is moving towards the standing ball.

And on the bottom right, there is momentum diagram, which does not change before and after collision.


Then I explained Optical Tweezer Theory using GeoGebra simulation.

There is detailed tutorial in GeoGebra description.

By moving the particle around, when it incident with laser beam, it make the beam refract, causing the momentum of the beam to be changed. And due to the change, the beam apply momentum to the particle towards the center of the laser, causing the particle to be trapped in the center axis. But, this is not useful because the laser is pusing the particle forever.

However, if the laser is focused, there is some region after the focal point where the momentum is applied towards (backwards) the focal point, which means there is a place for a particle to be trapped.


Then, using actual demonstration kit, I trap the soot particle at the focal point of the laser, and moving it around to show it is trapped.

Finally, by showing a couple of examples of using optical tweezer, one from BYU and one from NanoTracker, explains that optical tweezer can be used in many different places. (and maybe mention Sir ‪Arthur Ashkin‬ won Nobel Prize 2018 with trapping live bacteria using optical tweezer?)
